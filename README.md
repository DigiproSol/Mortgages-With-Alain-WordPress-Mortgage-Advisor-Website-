# Mortgages-With-Alain-WordPress-Mortgage-Advisor-Website-
A responsive WordPress site for a mortgage advisor, designed to convert visitors into inquiries with clear service cards (refinance, renewals, reverse mortgage, buying a home), trust indicators, FAQs, blog, and lead-capture forms. 

Long Project Brief

Mortgages With Alain is a conversion-focused WordPress build for an independent mortgage specialist. The homepage leads with a confident hero and a primary CTA to book a consultation, then routes users into clearly labeled service paths—Reverse Mortgage, Mortgage Renewal, Refinance, Buying a Home—each presented as visual cards for quick scanning. Mid-page value blocks reinforce the offer (competitive rates, trusted advice, fast process), followed by credibility elements (experience stats and testimonials), an education layer (blog highlights), an FAQ accordion to reduce friction, and multiple contact points/scheduling prompts. The layout is fully responsive and optimized for clarity and trust.
